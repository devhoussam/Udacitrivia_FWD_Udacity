### A.1. Installing Dependencies 🔥🔥

#### A.1.1. Python 3.8 👨‍💻👨‍💻

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### A.1.2. Virtual Environment 👨‍💻👨‍💻

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
also, checkout [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), as it's a great package to manage virtual environments.

#### A.1.3. PIP Dependencies 👨‍💻👨‍💻

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

#### A.1.4. Project Key Dependencies 👨‍💻👨‍💻

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.
